            <ul class="box2-comp">
                <li><b>Salted Butter.</b> Unsalted and gee are good substitutes.
                     You can also use olive oil, although I don’t recommend it because you loose that buttery, 
                     salty exterior which is just divine.</li>
                <li><b>Eggs.</b>Use organic, pasture-raised, large brown eggs for the best results.</li>   
                <li><b>Shredded Cheddar Cheese.</b>Choose your favorite cheese. We prefer sharp cheddar, 
                    but other suggestions include: gouda, mozzarella, Colby Jack, etc.</li>  
                    <li><b>Vegetables:</b>zucchini, bell peppers, spinach, corn, broccoli (cut small), onions, leeks, tomatoes, etc.</li>   
                    <li><b>Meats.</b>crumbled and cooked breakfast sausage, bacon, Canadian bacon, ham, smoked salmon, leftover cooked chicken, 
                        smoked pork, shredded chicken, etc.</li>   
                    <li><b>Starches.</b>oven roasted potatoes, roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, mushrooms, etc.</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
           <h3> Prepare the Filling</h3>
<p>The first step in this omelette recipe is to prepare the fillings. There are endless possibilities when choosing fillings for your omelette,
 so I will walk through two: a vegetarian omelette and a bacon omelette. Of course, you can skip the fillings and just use cheese if you’d prefer.
<br>
It’s important to prepare the fillings before you start cooking the eggs for the omelette recipe because you want them ready to add to the center to avoid over-cooking the omelette.
</p>
<h2>Vegetarian Omelette</h2>
    <p>To make a veggie omelette, dice 1 cup of your favorite vegetables.</p>
    <br>
    Then, over medium-high heat, sauté the vegetables and garlic in olive oil until soft, about 3-5 minutes depending on the vegetables you choose.
<br>
<p>Set them aside to use later.
Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook.
</p>
<br>
<p>Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.</p>
<br>
<p>Then, sprinkle the cheese over the top of the omelette and add the toppings on one half of the omelette.</p>
<br>
<p>Then, gently fold the other half over the toppings.</p>
